### Purpose: 

Understanding the ongoing COVID19 pandemic is challenging and to achieve a break-through we will be working on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which is causing respiratory illness in humans. Specifically, we will be working on forecasting the reported cases, deaths and recoveries. We will analyze how several government actions including shelter-in-place/stay-at-home orders and social distancing are making an impact on the exponential forecasts. We will also carry out multi-dimensional analysis among different countries to further investigate the insights of COVID19.

### Data Source: 

The dataset was sourced from European Center for Disease Prevention and Control which has the geographic distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide upto date. This dataset size is 316.76KB and has 7516 rows and 10 columns [1], though this size will obviously grow daily.
